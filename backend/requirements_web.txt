# For Mac Silicon, standard onnxruntime usually leverages CoreML automatically or we install onnxruntime-silicon explicitly if needed.
# But standard pip install onnxruntime often suffices or we might need a specific instruction.
# For now, let's just add the generic one and allow user to adjust for their specific hardware if 'gpu' fails.
