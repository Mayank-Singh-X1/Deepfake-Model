# Glossary of Terms

## Deep Learning Terms
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**: A type of deep learning model particularly effective for image analysis. Used in DeepGuard's RGB branch.
- **ViT (Vision Transformer)**: A model architecture that treats images as sequences of patches, allowing it to understand global context and long-range dependencies.
- **GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)**: A class of AI frameworks where two neural networks contest with each other. A common method for creating Deepfakes.
- **Diffusion Model**: A newer class of generative models (like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion) that generate images by gradually denoising random static.
- **Grad-CAM**: A technique for "Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping". It produces a visual heatmap showing which parts of an image the model "looked at" to make its decision.

## System Terms
- **Inference**: The process of using the trained model to make a prediction on a *new, unseen* image.
- **Logits**: The raw, unnormalized scores output by the final layer of the neural network before being converted into probabilities.
- **Checkpoint**: A saved version of the model's weights (parameters) at a specific point in training.
- **Epoch**: One complete pass through the entire training dataset during the training phase.
