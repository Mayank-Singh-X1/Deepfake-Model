# DeepGuard Documentation

Welcome! This is your complete guide to understanding and using **DeepGuard** - a smart tool that helps you spot fake AI-generated images.

## 🤔 What is DeepGuard?

DeepGuard is like a detective for images. It can tell if a picture was taken by a real camera or created by an AI computer program (what we call "deepfakes"). Think of it as a lie detector test, but for photos!

### Why Does This Matter?

These days, AI can create incredibly realistic fake images of people, places, and things that never existed. These fake images can be used to:
- Spread false information
- Trick people into believing things that aren't true
- Create fake evidence
- Impersonate real people

DeepGuard helps you catch these fakes before they fool anyone!
