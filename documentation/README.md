## ✨ Features

*   **Multi-Modal Detection**: Analyzes images using 4 distinct branches:
    *   **RGB** (Visual Artifacts)
    *   **Frequency** (Spectral/Grid Artifacts)
    *   **Patch** (Local Inconsistencies)
    *   **ViT** (Global Semantic Logic)
*   **Explainable AI**: Generates **Heatmaps** to show exactly *why* an image was flagged.
*   **Web Interface**: Clean, modern dashboard for easy dragging-and-dropping of images.
*   **API Ready**: REST API allows integration into other apps.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
While DeepGuard is trained on a vast dataset of real and fake images, no detection system is 100% perfect. This tool should be used as an *aid* for verification, not as absolute proof.
